## About

Hop Around is a mobile game that uses gyroscope technology to allow a small frog automaton to navigate puzzles created from scratch by its owner.

## Gyroscope

As a project created for mobile, we had to rethink the way the game was played, and the choice to use the gyroscope came rather quickly and enabled the game to take shape. By tilting the phone, players can therefore tilt the world around their character to move through the game's levels.

## List of mechanics

| Name             | Description     |
| :--:|:------:|
| **Gyroscope** | The gyroscope allows the player to move from left to right simply by tilting the phone. They can also tap the phone screen to jump. |
| **Tongue** | The frog's tongue is a tool that can both grip objects and activate levers. It is used when the player taps an interactible object. 
| **Tadpoles** | In the various levels, the player can collect up to 3 tadpoles which will serve as a score and follow the player to the end of the level. |

## Missions
